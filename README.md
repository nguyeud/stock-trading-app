## What is stout stonks?
stout stonks was created for our capstone project and is a simple stock watching web app to help the casual investor track their favorite exchanges. It has the functionality to track trends over multiple time periods, view current stock information and save to favorites, and view the latest general, market, business, and technology news.

## Future Features
Due to the time limitation in our project, there were a few features that were felt out. If we had more time, we would have loved to implement: 
1. Account Creation - Implement a database for consumers to sign-up to save stocks instead of local storage
2. Trading and Selling - Using their account, they can buy and sell stocks in their portfolio
3. Automated Refresh - Ability to see real time update on the Dashboard page
